### Ideally, each viz would communicate one “takeaway”: one small piece of analysis
- Eg, “The relationship among these variables changes according to day of the week”
- This takeaway should be written!  On the slide in a deck (in as few words as possible, like everything on a slide) or in markdown in a README or notebook

### Eliminate everything that’s not essential to that takeaway
- Labels
- Parts of the viz itself
  - Eg, don’t graph five lines when what you want to communicate is about one line 

### Make labels large enough to read
- Stylistically, often better to make them in presentation
