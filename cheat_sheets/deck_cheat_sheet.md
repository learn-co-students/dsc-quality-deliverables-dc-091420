## Structure

- **Context**: What is the big question you are investigating? What do you imagine an answer might be that your analysis will provide evidence for?

- **Preview** - Give them enough to keep their interest throughout the more difficult parts of the presentation.

- **Familiarize dataset** - Where is the data from?  How many rows / features is it?  Share relevant parts of your EDA.

- **Outline the process** - How did you go about getting your results?

- **Results** - Help them understand how good your model is or why it isnâ€™t great.

- **Real world application** - How did you answer your question above?  How can someone who is faced with that question in the real world use your analysis to make a decision or guide an action?  What sort of groups are able to use your analysis?
